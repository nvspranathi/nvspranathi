### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Pranathi here!
I'm currently working on ROS and Python. 
I'm currently learning simulating robotic arms and AMRs.
I'm looking for help with learning ROS and related stuff more better.
Ask me about Python, ROS and AMRs.
Reach me on pranathinvs@gmail.com
Fun fact: I am more messy than a bunch of wires until I understand the stuff clearly.
On my way to make the real cool stuff ðŸ’¥
